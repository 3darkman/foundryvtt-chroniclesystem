# Chronicle System for Foundry VTT

This is a fan-created implementation of **Green Ronin's Chronicle System** for **Foundry VTT**, this system is used in Swords Chronicle RPG and Song of Ice and Fire RPG. 

It currently only has one functional character sheet with the following characteristics:
- rollable test values
- armor's bulk and penalty values influencing the character
- Fatigue, Frustration, Stress, Injury, and Wound values affect the character's rolls (although the Ability tab still shows the basic abilities values)
- weapon and armor states change between equipped or not, offhand or not (although I still need to work on adaptable weapons)

some of the future implementations include:
- a sorcery tab on the character sheet (I haven't done it yet, as I don't really know the rules)
- the house sheet as a new type of actor to the FoundryVTT.
- improve the layout and show more information for the dice roll in chat.
- implement the initiatives for the different types of interactions, currently no Initiative is implemented.
- create a system for items and qualities in which, when registered, they already define their modifiers and penalties.
- implement localization in the system, currently it is only in English and only works with items (qualities, skills, etc) in English
- among others (feel free to request new features in the Issues tab of Git Hub)
